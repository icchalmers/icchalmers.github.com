&lt;p&gt;"Nothing is more dangerous than an idea when it is the only one you have." - Emile Chartier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've actually got a few potential final projects, and I have no doubt that I'll think of more as the weeks go on. Here's what I've thought of so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Word Clock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my Mum's Christmas last year I decided I would make her a word clock. It was inspired by &lt;a href="http://imgur.com/a/iMXmj?gallery"&gt;this word clock posted on imgur&lt;/a&gt;. Here's my version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src ="/images/wordClock_v1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started thinking about making it in August. It was going to have an app that connected over Bluetooth to set the time (and re-sync the time to the phone automatically when it was in range, &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt;...), chose the colour of the LEDs and set alarms. It was going to have a beautiful teak fame (I even took an evening class in woodworking so I could make it). It was going to have a custom PCB I had had made at &lt;a href="https://oshpark.com/"&gt;OSH Park&lt;/a&gt;, running on an ARM Cortex M0+ (and it certainly was &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; going to use two Arduinos or have the kind-of-beautiful but also kind-of-vomit-inducing wiring of the one I was using for inspiration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was going to be &lt;strong&gt;AWESOME&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I ended up doing all of the work in a panicked two days at the end of December because our FabLab was closing a week earlier than I expected and I &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; hadn't had the time to work on it between August and December...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hey, it worked, and my Mum loved it. Take the front off and put it in test mode and it even makes a pretty good disco light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src ="/images/insideWordClock_v1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promised her a revised version "soon". One where she could do all (&lt;strong&gt;cough&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;cough&lt;/strong&gt;) of the above. Especially the necessary things like, you know, being able to set the time... (It works for now. It uses a battery backed RTC that shouldn't be off by more than a minute over an entire year. It only has a time resolution of five minutes anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;However...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like it's cheating choosing a final project where I already have a V1.0. Instead, I'll probably do V2.0 development as part of my weekly classes. Maybe add some capacitive touch buttons hidden under the wood, or an ESP8266 to pull network time in over WiFi. Perhaps add a light sensor to automatically control the brightness of the LEDs so they don't blind you at night. Who knows. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Light Up Catan Table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget Monopoly. All it's good for is destroying friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src ="/images/monopolyFlip.jpg" title="Seriously, don't play it" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, play &lt;a href="http://www.catan.com/"&gt;Catan&lt;/a&gt;. My first impression was "wow this looks super nerdy". Not that there's anything &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; with super nerdy. In actual fact, all the cool kids are playing it - &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2015/01/16/the-green-bay-packers-are-obsessed-with-settlers-of-catan/"&gt;even the Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; (who may or may not be cool. I have no idea. I hate American football).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src ="/images/catanBaseBoard.jpg" title="So much more fun. Source: https://garydgardiner.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/settlersofcatan.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one big problem with Catan though: the board. Over time, those cardboard pieces warp and it becomes &lt;strong&gt;IMPOSSIBLE&lt;/strong&gt; to get a flat board that stays together. It also takes &lt;strong&gt;FOREVER&lt;/strong&gt; to set up. That picture is just the base game for 3-4 players. Throw in an expansion pack and increase it to 5-6 players and suddenly setting up the board can take almost as long as actually playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of people have tried to solve these problems. The board has been &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/trammel/the-official-settlers-of-catan-gaming-board"&gt;kickstarted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.iceboxrobotics.com/blog/2012/1/19/settlers-of-catan-3d-game-board.html"&gt;3D printed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Custom-Laser-Cut-Catan-Board/"&gt;laser cut&lt;/a&gt;. Hell, it's even been &lt;a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Catan-Cakes/"&gt;baked&lt;/a&gt;. You could probably complete the entire Fab Academy doing projects based just on the Catan board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have yet to see a version of Catan that uses the electronic component closest to any electronic engineer's heart: &lt;strong&gt;LEDs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to make a coffee table with embedded RGB LEDs, similar to this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://imgur.com/a/CGV17"&gt;&lt;img src ="/images/LEDTable.jpg" title="Pretty damn cool" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of having a square grid, it would have a hexagonal one. You could automatically generate a game board, or load a favourite one. It could even be linked into an app to allow control of the table/game (app development &lt;em&gt;*shudder*&lt;/em&gt;). You would still need the pieces from the original game (no bad thing - with such easy digital fabrication, board game piracy is already becoming a thing), but overall set up time would be reduced and the board would be relatively frustration free. There are a whole host of extra features that I could implement too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are some glaring challenges from the get go. Making a hexagonal grid would be difficult, and making a table isn't exactly easy. Although there is the "Make Something Big" week, our FabLab doesn't actually have a large format CNC machine. We'll be going to &lt;a href="http://www.maklab.co.uk/"&gt;MAKLab&lt;/a&gt; to complete that assignment, but something like an LED table would need more time than we have allotted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall though, this is the idea that I'm most excited about, so it's the goal for now. Ask me how I feel about it the day before projects are due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Home Automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have some much more ephemeral ideas about home automation. A lovely wireless network of sensors controlling everything I can conceivably think might benefit (or not) from a connection to the internet. The Internet of Things is all the rage right now after all. Does my bin really &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be connected to the internet?! Why the hell not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is pretty much on the back burners for now. I might do a mini version for the networking week. After all, I am doing a PhD in wireless communications, and there is nothing an engineer loves more than showing off. &lt;em&gt;[Famous last words....]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Week 1: Principles, Practices and Project Management</title><link href="http://icchalmers.github.io/week-1-principles-practices-and-project-management.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Iain Chalmers</name></author><id>tag:icchalmers.github.io,2015-01-28:week-1-principles-practices-and-project-management.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This Weeks Assignment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assignment for this week is split into two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a personal site in the class archive to track my progress through the Fab Academy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document some potential final projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about how I went about designing this website. My ideas for a potential final project can be found in the &lt;a href="/final-project-proposal.html"&gt;Final Project Proposal&lt;/a&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building a Website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've not done any web development since I was in high school, coding in raw HTML in notepad, so I had to do quite a bit of research and experimenting to bring myself up to speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the limitations imposed by the Fab Academy archive (static files only, no database, PHP etc.) I decided that I would try and use a static site generator. There were a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; to choose from. In the end I narrowed my selection down to two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://octopress.org/"&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt;: Described as "&lt;em&gt;A blogging framework for hackers&lt;/em&gt;". It's a static site generator based on Jekyll and uses Ruby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;: A static site generator based on Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main reason for going down the static site generator route was that I can focus on content, leaving a lot of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript production "behind-the-scenes".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to give Octopress a try first, as it looked to be the more popular option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trying Octopress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blogging framework for hackers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds just like what I was looking for! Here's the thing - I tried setting Octopress up on three different machines, on both Windows and Linux Mint, and had a different set of problems for every install. It was a nightmare. While I do most of my development on Windows, I do jump into Linux sometimes so I wanted a workflow that would work happily across both platforms. On top of that, not being able to get through a "Getting Started" style tutorial without errors, not once but &lt;strong&gt;THREE&lt;/strong&gt; times, is usually a sign to move onto something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the install problems revolved around getting Ruby installed and working correctly. Never having looked at a line of Ruby in my life also wasn't going to help if I did find I had to jump into the source to change something to work how I wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trying Pelican&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican was next for evaluation, and thankfully it went a lot better. For starters, I've managed to install it on all three of my computers, in both Windows and Linux Mint. I'm also "conversational" in Python, so having an engine written in a language I can make changes in is a big plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having got a basic site up and running without any issue, I started looking at customisation for my Fab Academy site. Theming in Pelican is pretty easy - just grab the theme and point to its location in your &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; file. Mobile devices were something I never had to consider back when I was using raw HTML in high school, but I think making a site today that isn't mobile compatible is pretty lazy. &lt;a href="http://getbootstrap.com/"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; seemed like it was just what I needed, and there was already a Pelican theme based on Bootstrap3: &lt;a href="https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3"&gt;pelican-bootstrap3&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://github.com/DandyDev"&gt;Daan Debie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still working on customising the theme to really get what I want, but it has a lot of really cool feature built in that should "just work". For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My posts &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have a comments section using &lt;a href="http://www.disqus.com"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; (They work in my local serve of the website. If they work on the Fab Archive will be another matter!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've got buttons for various social networks so that people can +1, Like and Tweet my articles in one click. It's all done through a service called &lt;a href="http://www.addthis.com/"&gt;AddThis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the features I'm looking to add are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, so that I can keep a track of who (if anyone!) is looking at my site. This should be pretty easy to setup, as the pelican-bootstrap3 theme already has support built it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A better navigation menu. I think a navigation menu that sits to the left of the main content works well for Fab Academy style sites, and I would have it collapse to the top for narrow (i.e. mobile) devices. Getting this up and running is involving a bit more customisation of the theme than I can manage this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll likely continue to make improvements to the site as the weeks go on. I've only just scratched the surface of web development but I'm really starting to enjoy it. Once I get more familiar with the "how" I can focus on the really hard bit: good design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site Source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the source for this site is in my BitBucket. Because I forked the &lt;code&gt;pelican-bootstrap3&lt;/code&gt; theme to make my own custom version, &lt;code&gt;pelican-bootstrap-fabacademy&lt;/code&gt;, it's hosted on my GitHub. I've managed to embed the theme on GitHub &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the Mercurial repo for the site. Probably a terrible idea, but it seems to work quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the website source here: &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/icchalmers/fabacademy2015_site"&gt;https://bitbucket.org/icchalmers/fabacademy2015_site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get just the theme here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/icchalmers/pelican-bootstrap3-fabacademy"&gt;https://github.com/icchalmers/pelican-bootstrap3-fabacademy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, Is A Static Site Generator Worth It?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most things in life, &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/"&gt;xkcd&lt;/a&gt; explains it better than I can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="xkcd: Automating" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png" title="'Automating' comes from the roots 'auto-' meaning 'self-', and 'mating', meaning 'screwing'." /&gt;   &lt;img alt="xkcd: Is It Worth The Time?" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png" title="Don't forget the time you spend finding the chart to look up what you save. And the time spent reading this reminder about the time spent. And the time trying to figure out if either of those actually make sense. Remember, every second counts toward your life total, including these right now." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, static site generators are great, and I especially like Pelican. The main problem is that they are all pretty much geared up for blog-style websites and that's not a format I think works well for a Fab Academy site. The best Fab Academy sites I've seen all have a pretty basic structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An "About Me" page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A section for weekly classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A section for the final project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Fab Academy sites have finite content. Let me clarify that: Fab Academy sites have a set number of pages and are only active for a couple of months. This isn't a blog I'll be writing forever and ever. In order to get the structure I wanted, I've basically been taking a hammer to the theme and content templates. And it's still not there. I would have been a lot quicker just setting up some basic temples to make a skeleton site and just filling in the content as I went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah well. Live and learn. That's pretty much what this whole process is about anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the real test: leave a comment, if they're working :P&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
